Print badges to the terminal. Yup, those nifty little thingies we use on readmes, but for CLI apps.

## Features
* Easy to use
* Inbuilt themes
* Customizable

This is what it can do:
```dart
var failedBadge  = Badge(label: 'failed', message: '2', theme: BadgeTheme.red);
var successBadge = Badge(label: 'success', message: '2').green();
var skippedBadge = Badge.yellow(label: 'skipped',  message: '2');

print(
    Badge.inline([
        failedBadge, 
        skippedBadge, 
        successBadge
    ]),
);
```

The above would output something similar to the terminal:

## Usage

Usage is simple, import the package and start creating Badges!

```dart
import 'package:cli_badges/cli_badges.dart';

var failedBadge = Badge(label: 'failed', message: '2', theme: BadgeTheme.red);

print(failedBadge);
```

### Some more examples:
You could create a donate badge:

```dart
var donateBadge = Badge.cyan(label: '‚ù§Ô∏è donate', message: 'please?');

print(donateBadge);
```

![](./images/donate-output-example.png)

You can also only show the label:

```dart
var onlyLabel = Badge(
    label: '‚ù§Ô∏è donate', 
    labelColorCode: 169
);

print(onlyLabel);
```

> ###### Example output is a mock, console output will vary slightly from terminal to terminal.

## Badge Structure <!-- omit in toc -->

A badge is conformed of a **label** and a **message** `<label>:<message>`. Each segment can be customized, by changing bg color, text color and style.

## Themes <!-- omit in toc -->
Themes are a way to store badge configuration for repeated use.

|         |                                           |           |                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `blue`  | ![theme-blue](../images/theme-blue.png)   | `cyan`    | ![theme-cyan](../images/theme-cyan.png)       |
| `green` | ![theme-green](../images/theme-green.png) | `magenta` | ![theme-magenta](../images/theme-magenta.png) |
| `red`   | ![theme-red](../images/theme-red.png)     | `yellow`  | ![theme-yellow](../images/theme-yellow.png)   |

You can also **swap** all themes, this means properties from label will be applied to message and vice versa.

### Inbuilt themes

- **red** : Red Message Background
- **green** : Green Message Background
- **blue** : Blue Message Background
- **yellow** : Black Colored Message on Yellow Background
- **cyan** : Black Colored Message on Cyan Background
- **magenta** : Black Colored Message on Magenta Background
- **success** : (_'Success'_) Message on Green Background
- **failed** : (_'Failed'_) Message on Red Background


### Colors

This is the list of all available colors:
* red
* black
* green
* yellow
* blue
* magenta
* cyan
* white
* brightRed
* brightBlack
* brightGreen
* brightYellow
* brightBlue
* brightMagenta
* brightCyan
* brightWhite

### Using themes
There are 3 main ways to create a themed badge:
#### 1 - Passing in the theme directly to the Badge constructor:
```dart
Badge(
    label: 'failed', 
    message: '2', 
    theme: BadgeTheme.red,
);
```

#### 2 - Using named constructors:
```dart
Badge.red(
    label: 'failed', 
    message: '2', 
);
```

#### 3 - Or by calling the predefined theme methods: 
```dart
Badge(...).red();
```
